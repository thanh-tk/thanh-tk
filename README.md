- 👋 Hi, I’m @thanh-tk

Why I'm here?

I'm on GitHub to learn from other developers, contribute to open-source projects, and build innovative and impactful software. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I want to be a developer who makes a positive impact on the world. I believe that technology has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, and I want to be a part of that.
